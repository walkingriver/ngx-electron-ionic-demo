# Ionic ngx-Electron Demo

Small Ionic app based on the Tabs template, hosted by ElectronJS as
a desktop app. A Tabs menu is added, enabling a user to navigate
from one tab page to another using this menu. 

The app shows how to send messages from the Electron Main process into
the Renderer process, and the Ionic/Angular code to respond to these
events. 

## Quick Start

Install the latest Ionic CLI:

```bash
npm install -g ionic
```

Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:walkingriver/ngx-electron-ionic-demo.git
cd ngx-electron-ionic-demo
```

Then run:

```bash
npm install
ionic serve -b
```

In a separate terminal window, run:

```bash
npm run mon
```
